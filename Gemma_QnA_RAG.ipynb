        "# Model Architecture and Approach to Retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to develop a Question-Answering (QA) system that extracts relevant information from a PDF document using vector-based retrieval and generates detailed answers with a generative language model. The approach combines several key components: PDF document processing, vector embeddings for retrieval, and a generative LLM to answer questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. PDF Document Processing\n",
        "   - **PDF Loader**: We use the `PyPDFLoader` from the LangChain framework to load PDF documents. This loader parses the PDF and extracts the textual content, which is then processed for further tasks.\n",
        "   - **Text Splitting**: Since PDFs can contain large chunks of text, we break down the document into smaller, manageable pieces using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. It divides the content into chunks of 1000 characters with an overlap of 200 characters between consecutive chunks. This overlap ensures that no important context is lost when splitting the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Vector Embeddings for Retrieval\n",
        "   - **Embeddings**: We use the `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` model (`embedding-001`) to generate vector embeddings for the document chunks. Vector embeddings are high-dimensional representations of the text that capture semantic meaning. These embeddings are generated based on the pre-trained model and are critical for the next step, which involves similarity-based retrieval.\n",
        "   - **Vector Store (FAISS)**: The document chunks and their corresponding embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an efficient tool for large-scale vector similarity searches. Once the embeddings are indexed, this store allows us to perform fast similarity searches based on query vectors.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Process Flow**:\n",
        "    1. The PDF document is loaded and split into smaller chunks.\n",
        "    2. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using the embedding model.\n",
        "    3. The vector embeddings are stored in a FAISS index to facilitate fast similarity search during queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Generative Responses Using a Language Model\n",
        "   - **Generative LLM**: The system uses the `Gemma2-9b-it` model from Groq, integrated with the `ChatGroq` API, to generate **faster** responses. This language model is capable of processing input queries and providing detailed, context-aware answers.\n",
        "   - **Chain Creation**: The documents retrieved from the vector store serve as the context for generating responses. The system uses the `create_stuff_documents_chain` method to combine the retrieved documents with the query, constructing a cohesive prompt for the LLM.\n",
        "   - **Prompt Template**: A `ChatPromptTemplate` is designed to ensure that the model generates answers based strictly on the provided context. The template is structured as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     Answer the questions based on the provided context only.\n",
        "     Please provide the most accurate and detailed response based on the question.\n",
        "     <context>\n",
        "     {context}\n",
        "     <context>\n",
        "     Questions:{input}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "     This format helps guide the LLM to restrict its output to the information contained in the document, avoiding hallucinations or off-topic responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. End-to-End Retrieval and Generation Process\n",
        "   - **Document Retrieval**: When a query is made, it is first converted into a vector embedding using the same `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` model. This query embedding is then used to search the FAISS vector store for the most semantically similar document chunks.\n",
        "   - **Generative Response**: The retrieved documents, which serve as the context, are passed to the LLM along with the query. The LLM processes the context and generates a detailed response, ensuring that the answer is accurate and context-relevant.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Process Flow**:\n",
        "    1. A user provides a query.\n",
        "    2. The system converts the query into an embedding and performs a similarity search on the FAISS vector store.\n",
        "    3. The retrieved documents are fed into the LLM along with the query, generating an answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Generative Responses Are Created\n",
        "1. **Query Vectorization**: The query is converted into a vector using the same `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` model, ensuring that it can be compared with the document embeddings stored in FAISS.\n",
        "2. **Document Retrieval**: The vectorized query is passed to FAISS to retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on cosine similarity.\n",
        "3. **Generative Model**: The retrieved documents are passed as context to the Groq LLM, which generates a response. The LLM is guided by the `ChatPromptTemplate` to ensure the answer is extracted and structured based on the document content.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Use Case\n",
        "For example, the user asks, **\"What is a function and its features?\"**:\n",
        "1. The query is vectorized and used to retrieve the relevant sections of a PDF document on functions.\n",
        "2. These document chunks (retrieved from the FAISS vector store) contain relevant descriptions and features of a function.\n",
        "3. The generative model processes the context and produces an answer summarizing what a function is and its key features.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach ensures that responses are grounded in the provided document and accurately reflect its content.\n"
